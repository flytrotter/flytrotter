### Hi👋

I'm  Sathvik!

I am a high school freshman 🏫 @ The Lawrenceville School. 

I love to code, learn, and swim 🏊‍♂.

🔭 I'm particularly interested in the intersection between social issues and technology, and how ML can be a solution to help address inequality and socioeconomic disparity.

🌱 I'm currently working on creating a website for a club, helping teachers integrate AI into the curriculum, and learning more about coding!
